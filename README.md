# ACADAMIC-PROJECTS
In pursuit of public safety, the project envisages a state-of-the-art Real-Time Violence Detection 
System easily deployable in live CCTV monitoring. Driven by the power of artificial 
intelligence and deep learning, the system identifies violent activity in real time and notifies 
security personnel in real-time through SMS, email, or mobile app alerts. Based on pre-trained 
deep learning architectures like ResNet50 and 3D CNNs with transfer learning, the system has 
superior accuracy in identifying violent vs. non-violent actions.For real-time processing of video 
feeds, OpenCV provides seamless integration with deployed surveillance systems, and TensorRT 
and ONNX optimization provide ultra-fast inference even on low-resource edge devices. This 
provides low-latency detection, and the system is thus suitable for real-world deployment in 
high-risk environments such as schools, public transportation hubs, and populous events.Along 
with accuracy, the system also covers such key concerns as reducing false alarms, scalability, 
and offering a simple, intuitive interface to facilitate effective monitoring. Thoroughly tested by 
a broad spectrum of environmental conditions, it is a robust, proactive, and scalable solution for 
security and law enforcement agencies. With its capability to rapidly analyze and respond to 
violent crimes, this system is a significant breakthrough in intelligent surveillance technology, 
towards safer cities and more intelligent policing.
